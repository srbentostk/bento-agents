# Changelog

## v1.5.0

### Features

- **Advanced Idle Behaviors** — Agents now autonomously transition to sitting on furniture (couches, chairs), sitting on the floor, or dancing when idle. Improves environmental immersion.
- **Synthesized AudioManager** — Web Audio API integration for retro-style notification sounds. Includes sounds for task completion, permission requests, strikes, and bubble pops.
- **30 FPS Performance Cap** — Implemented a frame-gate in the game loop to reduce CPU/RAM overhead, ensuring a stable and efficient simulation.
- **Strike Visual Effects** — Integrated a red vignette and screen-shake effect triggered by rate-limit "Strike" events for better visual feedback.
- **UI/CSS Unification** — Maximized canvas area and unified button styles (38px height, consistent pixel font/borders) across the main application and toolbar.

### Fixes

- **Agent Despawn Logic** — Implemented a 5-minute inactivity timer (300s) that triggers an exit animation and removes idle agents from the workspace.
- **Sprite Animation Corruption** — Fixed issues with frame indexing for new idle states.

### Maintenance

- Update version metadata across all project documentation.
- Performance optimization of the main rendering loop.

## v1.2.0

### Features

- **External asset packs** ([#169](https://github.com/pablodelucca/pixel-agents/pull/169)) — Load furniture assets from user-defined directories outside the extension, enabling third-party asset packs alongside built-in furniture. Add/remove directories via Settings modal with live palette refresh.
- **Bypass permissions mode** ([#170](https://github.com/pablodelucca/pixel-agents/pull/170)) — Right-click the "+ Agent" button to launch with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, skipping all tool-call approval prompts.
- **Improved seating, sub-agent spawning, and background agents** ([#180](https://github.com/pablodelucca/pixel-agents/pull/180)) — Agents prefer seats facing electronics (PCs, monitors). Sub-agents spawn on the closest walkable tile to their parent instead of claiming seats. Background agents stay alive until their queue-operation completes.
- **Agent connection diagnostics and JSONL parser resilience** ([#183](https://github.com/pablodelucca/pixel-agents/pull/183)) — Debug View shows agent connection state with diagnostic info. JSONL parser handles malformed/partial records gracefully. Simplified file watching to single poll for reliability.
- **Browser preview mode** ([#143](https://github.com/pablodelucca/pixel-agents/pull/143)) — Preview the Pixel Agents webview in a browser for development and review.
- **Always show overlay setting** — Option to keep agent overlay labels visible at all times, with reduced opacity for non-focused agents.

### Fixes

- **Agents not appearing on Linux Mint and macOS without a folder open** ([#70](https://github.com/pablodelucca/pixel-agents/pull/70)) — Falls back to `os.homedir()` when no workspace folder is open, matching Claude Code's own behavior.

### Testing

- **Playwright e2e tests** ([#161](https://github.com/pablodelucca/pixel-agents/pull/161)) — End-to-end test infrastructure using Playwright's Electron API with a mock Claude CLI, validating agent spawn flow in a real VS Code instance.

### Maintenance

- Add feature request template and update community docs ([#164](https://github.com/pablodelucca/pixel-agents/pull/164))
- Bump Vite 8.0, ESLint 10, and various dependency updates
- CI improvements: skip PR title check for Dependabot, restrict badge updates to main repo ([#181](https://github.com/pablodelucca/pixel-agents/pull/181))

## v1.1.1

### Fixes

- **Fix Open VSX publishing** — Created namespace on Open VSX and added `skipDuplicate` to publish workflow for idempotent releases.

## v1.1.0

### Features

- **Migrate to open-source assets with modular manifest-based loading** ([#117](https://github.com/pablodelucca/pixel-agents/pull/117)) — Replaces bundled proprietary tileset with open-source assets loaded via a manifest system, enabling community contributions and modding.
- **Recognize 'Agent' tool name for sub-agent visualization** ([#76](https://github.com/pablodelucca/pixel-agents/pull/76)) — Claude Code renamed the sub-agent tool from 'Task' to 'Agent'; sub-agent characters now spawn correctly with current Claude Code versions.
- **Dual-publish workflow for VS Code Marketplace + Open VSX** ([#44](https://github.com/pablodelucca/pixel-agents/pull/44)) — Automates extension releases to both VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX via GitHub Actions.

### Maintenance

- **Add linting, formatting, and repo infrastructure** ([#82](https://github.com/pablodelucca/pixel-agents/pull/82)) — ESLint, Prettier, Husky pre-commit hooks, and lint-staged for consistent code quality.
- **Add CI workflow, Dependabot, and ESLint contributor rules** ([#116](https://github.com/pablodelucca/pixel-agents/pull/116)) — Continuous integration, automated dependency updates, and shared linting configuration.
- **Lower VS Code engine requirement to ^1.105.0** — Broadens compatibility with older VS Code versions and forks (Cursor, Antigravity, Windsurf, VSCodium, Kiro, TRAE, Positron, etc.).

## v1.0.2

### Bug Fixes

- **macOS path sanitization and file watching reliability** ([#45](https://github.com/pablodelucca/pixel-agents/pull/45)) — Comprehensive path sanitization for workspace paths with underscores, Unicode/CJK chars, dots, spaces, and special characters. Added `fs.watchFile()` as reliable secondary watcher on macOS. Fixes [#32](https://github.com/pablodelucca/pixel-agents/issues/32), [#39](https://github.com/pablodelucca/pixel-agents/issues/39), [#40](https://github.com/pablodelucca/pixel-agents/issues/40).

### Features

- **Workspace folder picker for multi-root workspaces** ([#12](https://github.com/pablodelucca/pixel-agents/pull/12)) — Clicking "+ Agent" in a multi-root workspace now shows a picker to choose which folder to open Claude Code in.

### Maintenance

- **Lower VS Code engine requirement to ^1.107.0** ([#13](https://github.com/pablodelucca/pixel-agents/pull/13)) — Broadens compatibility with older VS Code versions and forks (Cursor, etc.) without code changes.
